# pylink
This is an updated version of pylink Python library by SR Research designed for Python 3.12.

It also contains an eyeLinkFramework.py file that simplifies language a bit for more easy work with the module. 


All rights go to SR Research for the pylink library, as I only modified the setup file for it to function on 3.12.
